                        It’s a theory. Rudi Garcia lasted in the job just eight months before leaving ‘by mutual agreement’ as they say. The theory going around online is that Ronaldo has created a difficult environment in the Al Nassr dressing room and that he didn’t have a good relationship with Garcia.

                        Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr manager sacked after dressing-room fallout

                    <p>
                        Al Nassr have sacked head coach Rudi Garcia, with the team second in the Saudi Arabian Pro League and just three points off the leaders.

The former Marseille and Lyon boss was in charge for less than ten months and departs amid reports that star signing Cristiano Ronaldo had been unhappy with Garcia’s approach during matches and tactical plan.

Spanish publication Diario AS suggested the former Real Madrid and Manchester United forward had told senior figures inside the Al Nassr that the set-up was not allowing the team to operate to the level it was capable of, resulting in a draw at struggling Al Feiha in particular.

Ronaldo was visibly angered at the end of that match, leaving the pitch after arguing with opponents following the full-time whistle and leading to reports in the Gulf state nation that the manager would be immediately sacked.
