                Cristiano Ronaldo was born on February 5, 1985 in Funchal, Madeira. He is the last child of Maria
                Dolores dos Santos Aveiro and José Dinis Aveiro. He gave his middle name Ronaldo because his father was
                a fan of Ronald Reagan. She has an older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia.
            </p>
            <p>
                He is currently with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodriguez. Ronaldo's first child with
                Rodriguez was born on 12 November 2017. The two got engaged in 2018. The couple currently lives in Turin
                with their 5 children.

                        Al Nassr have sacked head coach Rudi Garcia, with the team second in the Saudi Arabian Pro
                        League and just three points off the leaders. The former Marseille and Lyon boss was in charge
                        for less than ten months and departs amid reports that star signing Cristiano Ronaldo had been
                        unhappy with Garcia’s approach during matches and tactical plan. Spanish publication Diario AS
                        suggested the former Real Madrid and Manchester United forward had told senior figures inside
                        the Al Nassr that the set-up was not allowing the team to operate to the level it was capable
                        of, resulting in a draw at struggling Al Feiha in particular. Ronaldo was visibly angered at the
                        end of that match, leaving the pitch after arguing with opponents following the full-time
                        whistle and leading to reports in the Gulf state nation that the manager would be immediately
                        sacked.
